# Player
You play as a hippie who has travelled to the Amazon Rainforest in the search of enlightenment however when you get to the forest you discover it is being cut down by a foresting corporation. You must defeat the corporation and move it out of the forest. The game continues to other levels where you progressively work toward ruling a harmonious world.

# Levels
A level is one unit of the game. One level is represented by a group of foresters chopping down a forest and a boss, which graphically are modelled after a big corporations logo. 

# Combat
## Forester Battles
The majority of battles you undertake as a player will be with foresters, as these progress you through a level. These battles are short engagements, you win them by simply jumping onto the head of the forester. When a forester “dies” his body ejects its “spirit shards”, as the player you have to tap on these spirit shards in order to have ammunition for when you have the boss.

## Boss Battles
In boss battles a player uses the spirit shards gained from putting the foresters(low-level enemies) to the left side of the force to defeat the boss. The boss meanwhile shoots ‘anti-spirit’ shards which cause the loss of spirit gained when shot at the player, eventually leading to the player having to start the level again. 

# Art
Currently we are going to create pixel art inspired by Quest of Ezra.

# Sound
There have been talks of opening up the good old DAW and writing out a nice lute tune. Who knows. This will probably be filled with something highly hippie.
